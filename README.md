# Pegasus Republic

Pegasus Republic is a Smart Contract deployed on the Binance Smart Chain.

The aim was to create a community project that aims to elimate developer control, greediness and manipulation. Instead of the developers deciding the inflation, tax and burn rates the community does through DAO governed voting.
